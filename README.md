# TalentArt
Did you think that [Vanilla](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?talent), [BC](http://calculators.iradei.eu/talents/), [Wrath](http://wotlk.openwow.com/talent), or even somehow [Cata](http://freecode.hu/wowtal/eng/?SH) was the best expansion? Do you miss your old artwork that sat behind those cookie cutter talents? Well I'm here to bring that back!

Yes, that's right. I put in artwork in the specialization selection frame, the talent frame, and the PvP talent frame. I've used a mixture of artworks from Blizzard's concept art, partially out of context Guild Wars 2 art that still fit decently in, and Artifact Weapon backgrounds.

Why? I like seeing the default game be better. The talents are boring to look at. Sure, we look at them probably for a minimal amount of time, but we still look at them. I remember the epicness I felt of looking at a talent tree and seeing the artwork displayed in the background. I have fond memories of many of them, and there's no real reason to. So I thought maybe I can bring back some, if even a sliver of that nostalgic feel back into the game.

I've had this idea in my head for almost a year, but it wasn't until recently I took up deciding to learn lua and actually make this a reality. I feel very happy I was finally able to get this done.

To do list:

Possibly create better backgrounds for the PvP talent frame. Only a few notable specs differentiate from each other (fire, frost, arcane for example).

~~Fix the Hunter Pet Spec Artwork.~~

~~Build compatibility with ElvUI, Aurora, and other Skin-like addons. Again, not enough lua knowledge yet, but I already have an idea.~~

Icons are from [Flat Player Icons](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24101-FlatPlayerIcons.html). They are only a part of the screenshots but don't come with my addon.

Thank you so much to everyone who supported me while making this addon! I've spent almost 20+ hours (so far) working on this between the artwork and making sure everything was right. Beyond that, I'm going to lose track.
