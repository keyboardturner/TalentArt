# TalentArt
Did you think that [Vanilla](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc) was the best expansion? Do you miss your old artwork that sat behind those cookie cutter talents? Well I'm here to bring that back!

Yes, that's right. I change the artwork in the talent frame. I've used a mixture of artworks from Blizzard's concept art, Blizzard class website page, and the Artifact trait backgrounds.

Why? Well, this addon actually has a little bit of history. It's one of the first addons I actually worked on, and originally it was for the purpose of placing the old artworks back into the talent frame. Before the Dragonflight talent rework, they didn't have a background image. The talents were boring to look at. For the most part, it was nostalgia. The current ones are great, and now they're just the default option that's selectable as a new option in a dropdown menu in the Interface Addons pane under TalentArt.

I've had this idea to reintroduce the addon for a long time, but it wasn't until recently I was able to bring it back.

To do list:

More artworks.

Background Color Selection / Texture Color Selection.

Re-build compatibility with ElvUI, Aurora, and other Skin-like addons.

Thank you so much to everyone who supported me while making this addon! I've spent almost ~~20+~~ many hours working on this between the artwork and making sure everything was right. Beyond that, I'm going to lose track.
